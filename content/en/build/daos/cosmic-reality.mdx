# Session III

We now know both the map of our distributed stars and their various constellations. We can read and use this map to navigate the shared universe we are all building together. However, DAOs don't exist in just one place. Often, their functions are distributed across different networks, depending on the specific needs they have and the contexts within which they operate.
